//IMP:- JSX is not a special way to embed HTML in JavaScript. All JSX does is replace a file's <tags> with equivalent calls to React.createElement(), we can see it live on Babel. Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

// 1... We can refer to JS variables inside a JSX block by using curly braces.

// 2... Always return JSX using() or grouping tags. Never give the return value undefined.

// 3... We can assign JSX elements to a variable, then we can show that variable inside a JSX block.

// 4... We can use JSX inside if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions.

// 5... We can assemble different JSX elements like normal HTML. (using view).

// 6... Any JavaScript expression will work between curly braces, including function calls like 
//     {getFullName("Vinod", "Kumar", "Thapa")}
